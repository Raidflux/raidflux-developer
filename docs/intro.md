# Introduction

## Welcome to our documentation page!

Raidflux is an auto-scaling multiplayer game server hosting platform. 
That's focussed on providing  
auto-scaled multiplayer game-server infrastructure to developers of any size by simplifying the  
process. We do this by providing a web-based interface that allows you to set up your infrastructure in a matter of minutes! 

You can find all the documentation you need to get Raidflux integrated in your game!

## Terminology & Autoscaling

**Console** - Our webinterface that allows you to set up a multiplayer game server infrastructure.  
**Team** - One or more user(s) that work together on a single infrastructure on the console of Raidflux.  
**Build Repository** - Page to upload and manage builds.  
**Build** - A packaged Linux targeted server application of a game.  
**Region Plan** - A plan where the user determines the type of fleetship and the mothership's deploy locations.  
**Region** - A central location (e.g. Amsterdam) and it's connect radius.  
**Deployment** - The place the user determines what build goes live using a specific Region plan.  
**Billing Profile** - Payment profile to assign to a team.  
:::importanty
**Mothership** - A Virtual Machine running Raidflux software that orchestrates a region and its fleetships.  
**Fleetship** - Virtual Machine hosting one or more game servers.  
**Seats** - The amount of open spots for players to join in a game server.  
**Game server** - An instance of the game server application uploaded by the user which clients of the game can connect to.  
**Autoscaling** - Automatically starting or stopping fleetships based on user traffic.  
**WebSocket** - A TCP socket implementing the web-socket protocol meant for real-time connections in web-browsers.  
**Rfcli** - Command line interface partially implementing Raidflux's API meant for use with CI/CD.

The user picks the Region(s) where a Mothership will take charge off. The Mothership sents out a fleetship that can have an x amount of game-servers, this is dependent on the strength of your fleetship and the amount of resources your game servers use. When all Seats are filled in a fleetship the Mothership gets signaled and makes sure a new fleetship gets deployed for the players in the waiting queue! But what if people decide to leave the Fleetship leaving it empty? In case of a empty Fleet ship the Mothership will recall it to make sure the user doesnâ€™t waste any valuable resources! This way the user only pays for what's used by the players of their game.

We currently have support for **Unreal Engine** and **Unity**.  
Support for **Godot** and other platforms/languages will get developed when there's a demand for it.
