# Integrating the client side

import {UETabs, CPPTab, BPTab} from "@site/src/components/CustomTabs/UETabs.js"

For the client side of Raidflux there are 2 functions that need to be called. The Raidflux plugin is integrated as a subsystem and is accessible wherever you have access to the ```UGameInstance```.

<UETabs>
  <CPPTab>
{`#include "Raidflux.h"
...  
URaidflux::GetInstance(GetGameInstance());`}
  </CPPTab>
  <BPTab>
    <img src={require('./assets/raidflux-subsystem-node.png').default} alt="subsystem node"/>
  </BPTab>
</UETabs>

To get a list of regions (Motherships) sorted based on distance to the user you can use the ```URadflux::FetchMotherships(const FString& deploymentID, const FRaidfluxOnMothershipsFetched& onCompletedCallback)``` function as shown below:

<UETabs>
  <CPPTab>
{`void ARaidfluxDemoGameMode::RefreshMotherships()
{
	FRaidfluxOnMothershipsFetched onMothershipsFetched;
	URaidflux::GetInstance(GetGameInstance())->FetchMotherships(this->deploymentID, onMothershipsFetched);
	onMothershipsFetched.BindDynamic(this, &ARaidfluxDemoGameMode::OnMothershipsFetched);
}
 
void ARaidfluxDemoGameMode::OnMothershipsFetched(const TArray<FMothership>& motherships) {
	...
}`}
  </CPPTab>
  <BPTab>
    <img src={require('./assets/fetch-motherships.png').default} alt="fetch motherships"/>
  </BPTab>
</UETabs>

Once you have a mothership, you can list its gameservers by using the ```FetchGameservers(const FString& mothershipID, const FRaidfluxOnGameserversFetched& onCompletedCallback)``` function as shown below:

<UETabs>
  <CPPTab>
{`void ARaidfluxDemoGameMode::RefreshGameservers(const FString& mothershipID)
{
	FRaidfluxOnGameserversFetched onGameserversFetched;
	URaidflux::GetInstance(GetGameInstance())->FetchGameservers(mothershipID, onGameserversFetched);
	onGameserversFetched.BindDynamic(this, &ARaidfluxDemoGameMode::OnGameserversFetched);
}
 
void ARaidfluxDemoGameMode::OnGameserversFetched(const TArray<FGameserver>& gameservers) {
	...
}`}
  </CPPTab>
  <BPTab>
    <img src={require('./assets/fetch-gameservers.png').default} alt="fetch gameservers"/>
  </BPTab>
</UETabs>

From here on you can use the gameservers array to connect to an available gameserver.

An example implementation of our plugin can be found in our demo project:
