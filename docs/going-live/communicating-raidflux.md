# Communicating with Raidflux
When you've uploaded your game, assigned a billing profile, created and enabled a deployment you're almost ready to start playing your game!
 
While the deployment is spinning up we can make sure the communication between your game and Raidflux can be established.  
**Copy the ID** of a deployment you've created by clicking on the text.
![uuid-copy](../raidflux-console/assets/copy-uuid.png)

We will use the ID of your deployment to let your game discover motherships and the game servers  
that Raidflux launched when your deployment got enabled!
