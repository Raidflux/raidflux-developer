# Preparing Unity

## Adding Linux build support
Raidflux only supports game servers build for linux. Luckily Unity supports compiling for linux out of the box.  
Before you can build for linux it is required to add the **Linux Build Support (Mono)** module, using the Unity Hub application.  

Open the Unity Hub application and navigate to "Installs". Click the options icon next to the Unity version you want to use
and select "Add Modules" as shown below
