# Setting up your project


If you havenâ€™t set up a multiplayer project yet, you can download our example project with the Raidflux-Unity plugin pre-installed:
https://github.com/Raidflux/raidflux-unity-demo

If you choose to use our example project, please continue at [Preparing the demo project](demo/prepare-demo).

If you want to implement Raidflux into your current project, you can download our Unity plugin ([raidflux.unitypackage](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LL7jPhPj3YCJxCeinv2I_uUItZyqelDF/view?usp=sharing)) and continue at [Integrating Raidflux](integrate/integrate-raidflux)
