# Setting up your project


If you havenâ€™t set up a multiplayer project yet, you can download our example project with the Raidflux Unreal Engine plugin pre-installed:
https://github.com/Raidflux/raidflux-unreal-engine-demo

If you choose to use our example project, please continue at [Preparing the demo project](demo/prepare-demo).

If you want to implement Raidflux into your current project, you can download our [Unreal Engine plugin](https://github.com/Raidflux/raidflux-unreal-engine/releases/latest) and continue at [Integrating Raidflux](integrate/integrate-raidflux)
