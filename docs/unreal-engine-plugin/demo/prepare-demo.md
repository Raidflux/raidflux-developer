# Preparing the demo project

Start by downloading our demo project from https://github.com/Raidflux/raidflux-unreal-engine-demo

Right click the RaidfluxDemo.uproject file and click on "Switch Unreal Engine version..." to make sure it points to the version you just compiled from source as shown below

![select engine version](./assets/select-version.png)

After that, right click the project and select "Generate Visual Studio project files" as shown below

![generate sln](./assets/generate-sln.png)

That's all for now! Open the project and continue at [Building your server](../build)
