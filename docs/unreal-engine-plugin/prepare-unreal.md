# Preparing Unreal Engine

Unfortunately, Unreal Engine doesn't support building dedicated servers out of the box, in order to do this you will have to build the engine from source. This sounds scary and difficult, but it's actually pretty easy. If you follow the steps in the urls below (in order) you'll have this set up in no time

1. https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/ue4-on-github
2. https://docs.unrealengine.com/4.26/en-US/ProgrammingAndScripting/ProgrammingWithCPP/DownloadingSourceCode/
3. https://docs.unrealengine.com/4.26/en-US/ProductionPipelines/DevelopmentSetup/BuildingUnrealEngine/

Once you completed these steps, you will have to add the dedicated server build target and enable building for linux. To add your dedicated server build target, follow the instructions as listed here: https://docs.unrealengine.com/4.26/en-US/InteractiveExperiences/Networking/HowTo/DedicatedServers/
