# Communicating with Raidflux
When you've setup your game, created a deployment, assigned a billing profile, and  
enabled your deployment you're almost ready to start playing your game!
 
Raidflux takes up to 5 minutes to spin up your servers after enabling a deployment. In the meantime , **copy the ID** of a deployment you've created by clicking on the text.
![uuid-copy](../raidflux-console/assets/copy-uuid.png)


We will use the ID of your deployment to let your game discover motherships and the game servers that Raidflux has deployed.
